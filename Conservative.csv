In  California  welfare  nets  you  around  17.87  an  hour  and  a  yearly  $37000.  In  Hawaii  the  equivalent  of  29.13  hourly  based  on  40  hr/w.How  do  you  get  it?  Fuck  up  and  need  it  or  be  a  lowlife  (the  second  is  much  more  commonly  the  case  sadly).  ,1
See  my  comment  [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/7d34ek/wh_budget_director_dont_blame_feds_for_new_yorks/dpvmz16/)  for  why  I  think  the  "red  states  are  takers  and  blue  states  are  givers"  argument  is  a  little  misleading.,1
Here's  CNN's  "editor  at  large"  and  his  humiliating  (for  CNN)  comment  on  twitter  about  Trump  drinking  water.https://twitter.com/CillizzaCNN/status/930900765056618496So  have  we  reached  the  stage  where  the  MSM  is  basically  like  "ehhhhh  fuck  it  no  one  is  going  to  believe  our  bullshit  anyway  let's  steal  money  from  leftist  morons"?,1

Big  part  of  why  I  was  so  excited  to  vote  for  Trump  is  because  I  thought  he'd  be  beneficial  to  the  libertarian  wing  of  the  parry  ,1
To  no.  2.  Because  I  would  bet  that  the  democrat  is  more  likely  to  propose  legislation  that  legalizes  molesting  14  year  olds  than  the  pedo  republican...  Reading  that  back  it  sounds  almost  like  a  joke.  It's  not.,1
Thank  the  lord  someone  actually  remembered  that  this  tax  bill  was  meant  to  provide  relief  to  the  middle  class  not  corporations  who  have  openly  admitted  that  they  are  not  going  to  invest  more  if  bill  is  passed.

Not  everyone  has  the  choice  to  not  be  in  a  high-risk  group.  Regardless  of  where  I  move  to  I  can't  avoid  the  fact  that  being  gay  puts  me  at  a  higher  risk  of  contracting  HIV  than  the  general  population.  Personal  responsibility  says  to  do  what  I  can  to  mitigate  the  risk.  It's  pretty  shocking  to  actually  hear  someone  say  they  disapprove  of  a  vaccine  to  prevent  HIV.,1
sure  but  what  do  you  want  them  to  do?    kick  em  out  and  ship  them  to  your  new  city  and  pretend  they  solved  the  problem?    that  is  all  other  cities  do...,1

>We  will  gain  4-7  Senate  seatsHoo  boy  I'm  a  conservative  but  if  we  can  find  someone  to  hold  the  cash  I  would  take  this  wager  for  a  *lot*  of  money.,1
A  delay  in  the  accusation  doesn't  mean  it's  true.    Lots  of  the  accusations  against  Bubba  Clinton  were  delayed  years.    Not  30-40  but  still  by  years.    Does  that  make  them  unbelievable?Rape  and  sexual  molestation  can  have  that  effect  on  the  victim.    They  very  often  don't  want  to  make  the  legal  accusation  because  they  have  to  relive  the  experience  over  and  over  and  they  want  to  put  it  in  the  past.,1

So  then  literally  you're  gonna  support  the  Republican  over  the  Democrat  no  matter  what?      Being  a  Democrat  is  worse  than  molesting  14  year  old  girls?    I'm  not  saying  he's  definitely  guilty  but  there  seem  to  be  a  lot  of  people  saying  that  even  if  he  *is*  guilty  that's  still  preferable  to  having  a  Democrat  in  office.,1
Gaining  seats  in  the  senate  means  nothing  if  Republicans  lose  the  House.,1

1.  Fair  enough.    Surprising  that  Democrats  are  so  liberal  even  in  deep  red  Alabama  but  maybe  not  such  a  surprise  these  days.2.  I  get  that.    We  are  in  a  prisoner's  dilemma...but  at  some  point  we  have  to  say  that  there  are  some  things  worse  than  losing  an  election.    Also  we  have  to  remember  that  our  options  are  not  (A)  back  Moore  no  matter  what  or  (B)  let  the  Democrat  win.    If  Moore  can  drop  out  and  a  credible  conservative  stands  up  for  a  write  in  they  can  avoid  either  option.,1
When  are  you  going  to  stop  believing  it's  a  hit  job?  He  isn't  even  really  denying  it.  His  argument  is  basically  "Uhhh  I  didn't  *generally*  date  teenagers  but  when  I  did  I  think  I  probably  would  have  asked  their  mom  first."  His  attorney  just  went  on  TV  and  tried  to  claim  that  this  is  all  normal  in  Alabama.,1
Also  California  makes  basically  no  real  long  term  investment  anymore.  When  was  the  last  major  infrastructural  or  civil  engineering  project  done?  We  could  use  a  ton  though!  Which  is  the  annoying  part.  Mass  Desalination  would  solve  our  water  issue.  Proper  infrastructural  development  of  mass  transit  would  help  ease  the  housing  crisis  by  letting  people  more  cheaply  live  far  away.  Repairing  the  nuclear  plant  or  making  a  new  power  plant  would  ease  the  major  electrical  dependencies  we  have  on  other  states.But  no.  Let's  save  a  fucking  fish.,1
And  if  they  do  and  come  to  conclusions  you  don't  like  you'll  call  them  all  pedophiles?  Can't  wait  to  see  the  disgusting  behavior  from  the  left  when  he  wins.,1

I  was  at  the  local  hardware  store  while  visiting  family  in  CA  and  they  had  a  prop  65  warning  on  the  woodworking  router  bits.    They  should  really  change  the  warning  message  to  be  "Life  is  known  to  the  state  of  California  to  lead  to  death."    It  seems  like  everything  is  "known  to  the  state  of  California  to  cause  cancer  or  other  reproductive  harm."    ,1
I  don't  even  have  words  low  enough  for  the  media  anymore,1
Literally  the  Anita  Sarkeesian  defense.  Can  you  imagine  the  harassment  Judge  Moore  is  currently  going  through?  Or  how  about  Hannity  almost  getting  his  show  cancelled  thanks  to  Media  Matters  for  the  second  time  this  year.Duh  *of  course*  empathy  is  only  for  the  Democrats....Also  which  politician  has  called  them  liars  besides  literally  Moore  himself?  Are  you  living  under  a  rock?,1
Dude  they're  just  objective  and  unbiased!  You  guys  just  hate  how  life  has  a  liberal  bias!  /s,1
Oh  you’d  be  surprised  at  how  much  worse  things  could  be.  We  would  all  be  surprised  to  learn  how  much  worse  things  actually  ARE  right  now.  This  problem  of  Moores  is  nothing  in  the  big  picture  of  politics.  I  don’t  like  him  but  I  don’t  think  these  11th  hour  accusations    are  reason  for  him  to  step  down.,1
Oh  I  was  just  answering  in  the  hypothetical.  As  to  Moore  him  self  I'd  never  vote  for  him  but  that  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  allegations.  I  don't  believe  them  and  it  wouldn't  matter  if  I  did  the  dems  are  going  to  do  this  increasingly  as  long  as  it  works.  In  order  for  it  to  sway  my  vote  they  are  going  to  need  SOLID  proof.,1

If  they  are  not  going  to  do  anything  about  it  then  at  least  don't  make  ridiculous  rules  that  let  people  permanently  live  in  tent  cities  on  the  streets  of  residential  areas  and  parks  making  both  of  those  inaccessible  and  dangerous  for  everyone  else  .  ,1

Time  to  shake  the  grass  to  startle  the  snakes.    Now  that  anything  from  the  past  40  years  is  up  for  renewed  scrutiny.

The  depravity  of  this  culture  knows  no  bounds  and  there  seems  to  be  fewer  and  fewer  places  to  actually  get  away  from  it.,1
Places  like  Montana  has  a  ton  of  federal  owned  land.  Where  the  private  sector  cannot  populate  and  make  money.  In  fact  the  federal  government  has  to  pay  it  money  to  exist.  Using  who  brings  in  more  than  it  spends  isn't  apples  to  apples,1
The  Russia  shit  was  transparently  a  fabricated  controversy  ever  since  Obama's  disgusting  press  conference  last  December.  Can  you  even  imagine  if  Bush  had  announced  an  investigation  in  October  2008  as  to  whether  the  first  black  president  was  a  Muslim  Socialist  born  in  Kenya  and  used  this  as  an  excuse  to  spy  on  his  campaign  during  the  election?,1
I  think  that  many  people  would  view  Medicare  and  Social  Security  as  safety  net  programs.  They're  safety  net  programs  for  older  individuals  so  it  seems  a  little  silly.  You  also  didn't  seem  to  include  Medicaid  as  well  unless  that  was  getting  listed  under  safety  net  which  wouldn't  make  sense  as  24%  if  SS  while  26%  if  Medicare/Medicaid/CHIP.  On  the  medicaid  end  look  at  the  contribution  rate  federal  vs  state.  https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-financing-how-does-it-work-and-what-are-the-implications/  It's  not  even  state  to  state.  Notice  how  many  traditional  red  states  have  the  federal  government  finance  their  program  more  than  traditionally  blue  states.  (This  was  also  a  reason  a  lot  of  red  states  avoided  the  expansion  the  government  already  picked  up  a  lot  of  the  tab  so  there  was  less  of  an  incentive)The  article  on  military  spending  also  points  out  that  the  bases  are  located  in  these  states  indicating  that  the  spending  is  there  in  many  different  ways.  You  also  don't  include  the  defense  spending  on  manufacturing  that  happens  in  a  lot  of  states.    I  also  grew  up  a  good  portion  of  my  life  in  rural  areas.  It's  where  I  learned  how  to  grow  corn  hunt  fish  etc...  I  have  the  utmost  respect  for  these  people.    ,1
I  don't  think  "legimitately  winning  a  US  election"  should  be  a  criminal  offense  but  then  again  I'm  not  a  Democrat  communist  so  I  don't  really  understand  what  it's  like  to  be  an  amoral  piece  of  shit  with  zero  principles.,1
I  think  the  tax  bill  is  dead  in  the  water  so  a  lot  of  lawmakers  are  going  to  tack  on  virtue  signalling  amendments.  The  fingers  are  already  going  to  be  pointed  blame  will  be  laid.  Folks  like  Rand  Paul  will  be  able  to  point  to  his  principled  stand  and  benefit  from  it.Politicians  are  always  looking  for  PR.  Always.,1
Thats  a  great  answer.To  add  to  that  red  states  like  Montana  are  60%  federal  land.  Which  means  private  sector  cannot  use  it  for  revenue  and  the  government  has  to  pay  to  support  it.  Giant  parks  need  upkeep.  Montana  could  produce  150%  of  their  current  income  if  they  owned  all  the  federal  land  of  their  state  (at  their  current  pace).,1

How  will  Drumpf  ever  recover?,1
If  that  was  true  though  we  would've  gotten  a  Republican  president  before  Trump  already.    Bad  tweets  and  his  attitude  may  impact  the  short  term  perception  of  a  leader  but  once  he's  gone  there  isn't  anyone  who  is  going  to  represent  what  Trump  means  to  some.    You  can't  expect  a  free-trade  religious  right  guy  to  come  in  and  think  everyone's  going  to  carry  on.  There's  also  a  possibility  the  polls  aren't  accurate  anyway.  If  Trump  gets  on  a  roll  with  pushing  forward  his  policies  and  tweets  no  one's  going  to  have  a  problem.  ,1
