Just  off  the  top  of  my  head  it’s  stinking  gorgeous.  It’s  the  end  of  the  Appalachian  Trail  and  has  tons  of  rivers  and  beautiful  white  sand  beaches.  It’s  home  to  NASA  and  lots  of  car  manufacturers  including  Mercedes.  It’s  the  college  football  Capitol  of  the  world  has  a  nationally  renowned  med  school  at  UAB  is  home  to  some  notable  people  including  actors  and  singers/bands  in  addition  to  authors  like  F.  Scott  Fitzgerald  and  Harper  Lee.  It’s  in  the  middle  of  a  craft  beer  revival  has  award-winning  barbecue  (and  home  of  white  barbecue  sauce).  It’s  the  birthplace  and  battleground  of  the  Civil  Rights  movement  (and  has  amazing  museums  recounting  that  struggle).  It  has  the  largest  helicopter  base  in  Ft.  Rucker  and  is  home  to  the  air  war  college  at  Maxwell  in  Montgomery  where  officers  from  all  over  the  world  come  to  train  and  learn  air  combat  and  home  of  the  Tuskegee  Airmen.

This  is  only  a  temporary  solution  though.  The  business  will  need  a  certain  amount  of  labor  as  measured  in  working  hours.  In  the  short  term  they  can  cut  hours  or  workers  to  spend  the  same  amount  of  dollars  but  either  they  will  suffer  in  productivity  or  else  they  had  too  much  labor  in  terms  of  working  hours  on  staff  to  begin  with  and  were  wasting  money.  Assuming  the  operation  is  more  efficient  then  increasing  wages  would  require  more  dollars  be  spent  on  labor  as  they  would  not  have  wasted  hours  on  the  books  to  cut.  You  can  try  to  force  workers  to  work  harder  but  there's  a  limit  to  how  far  you  can  push  that.  ,0

As  a  business  owner  and  stock  investors  it  baffles  me  how  wrong  these  economic  advisors  are  at  understanding  what  incentivises  business  investments.  Investments  are  always  chasing  forecasted  demand.  Ford  is  only  going  to  build  a  new  factory  for  sedans  if  they  see  a  rising  appetite  for  focus  and  tarus.  Cutting  the  corporate  tax  doesn't  directly  effect  Ford's  demand  forecast.  Yes  they  have  more  profit  after  tax  but  their  customers  remain  mostly  the  same.To  a  logical  company  an  increase  in  profit  and  no  change  in  Outlook  of  demand  generally  is  an  incentive  for  mergers  and  acquisitions.  Since  there's  no  demand  to  chase  a  good  CEO  would  chase  integration  vertical  or  horizontal.  Buy  up  your  suppliers  and  cut  out  the  middle  man  or  buy  out  your  competition.  Exception  perhaps  is  for  startups  or  companies  in  high  growth  areas  such  as  Tesla  but  they  generally  carry  huge  losses  so  a  tax  cut  is  not  effecting  their  capital  situation.A  careful  calculated  tax  cut    targeting  the  middle  and  lower  middle  class  would  certainly  have  demand  and  therefore  economy  boosting  effects.  Corporate  tax  cuts  will  just  fuel  stock  bubbles  and  merger  craze  which  might  already  be  happening.,0

Postimus  what  part  of  the  Rosneft  deal  do  you  think  the  dossier  claims  was  offered  to  Trump/Page?  In  the  body  of  the  memo  on  Rosneft  it  says:"he  offered  PAGE/TRUMP's  associates  the  brokerage  of  up  to  a  19  per  cent  (privatised)  stake  in  Rosneft  in  return"However  in  the  summary  section  on  the  top  of  that  dossier  page  it  also  says:"Substance  included  offer  of  large  stake  in  Rosneft  in  return  for  lifting  sanctions  on  Russia"I  always  see  people  mention  the  part  about  the  commission  but  never  the  summary  line  at  the  top.  My  guess  is  that  Trump  was  offered  a  19%  stake  in  Rosneft  and  Page/associates  were  offered  the  0.5%  commission.  Do  you  think  that's  wrong?  It  seems  like  the  consensus  at  this  point  is  Trump  was  only  offered  the  commission  but  I  don't  normally  think  of  a  "large  stake"  in  a  company  to  consist  of  the  commission  from  the  sale.

I  grew  up  in  rural  Alabama.  32  year  olds  dating  14  year  olds  is  not  the  norm.

The  people  who  support  him  either  think  it's  a  lie  made  up  by  liberals  or  they  are  looking  for  ANY  excuse  to  support  a  republican.
